                            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
							<p>Three high school friends, all with some connection to STEM, discussing what originally got them into the STEM field. The robotics team, their father, a friend. All three were fortunate enough to have some gateway. But what about students who don't? Students growing up in <b>poor neighborhoods</b> and going to <b>underfunded schools</b>? Where do they turn to? They turn to extracurricular programs. Weekend programs, summer programs. Overpriced programs. How are you suppoed to discover STEM when you need thousands of dollars just to experience it? We decided that needed to change.</p>
							<h3>The Problem</h3>
							<p>The world needs innovators, thinkers and problem solvers. As of right now, the amount of engineering graduates is less than <b>10 percent</b> of that of psychology or law graduates. There are kids who never get to experience engineering, programming or circuitry. Schools just don't offer those programs, summer programs are too expensive and only provide a basic classroom experience. We need a new kind of program. One that makes learning <b>fun</b>, one that <b>inspires</b>. We need <b>Kinet-X</b>.</p>
							<h3>The Solution</h3>
							<p>The idea is simple. A program that makes learning Engineering <b>enjoyable</b>, <b>affordable</b>, <b>educational</b> and <b>makes an impact.</b></p>
				            <div class="list">
                                <b class='title'>Enjoyable</b>
                                <p>It should be obvious that taking notes and staring at a slideshow isn't the best way to learn any form of technical skill- including engineering. Why is it that that's how it's being taught then? Lessons need to be <b>hands-on</b>. Activities have to range in difficulty, from ones that test basic understanding to ones that present a challenge far beyond the students' level, so that no one feels left behind. No one should leave a program feeling empty because they couldn't keep up, or feeling like they learned nothing because they knew it all. Student's should leave a program feeling content, and proud of what they accomplished.</p>
                                <b class='title'>Affordable</b>
                                <p>It's time that price stops being the reason students miss out on discovering their passion. Kinet-X has a base cost of <b>$650</b>- which includes meals/snacks and cost of materials for the entire 4-weeks. However, price is a factor that we refuse to inhibit student's from changing the future, so Kinet-X will offer need-based <b>financial aid</b> to those that are enthusiastic about joining our program. </p>
                                <b class='title'>Educational</b>
                                <p>Working with companies like General Assembly and Knewton, we strive to ensure our content is the best. We strive to utilise peer mentorship - fellow youth with experience in tech . The goal is for students to feel comfortable with their teachers, to not be afraid to make mistakes and ask questions. Kinet-X also provides trained volunteers - industry professionals in tech - to partner with our peer mentors and work as a team to deliver tech education. </p>
                            </div>
                            <h3>Making an Impact</h3>
                            <p>Kinet-X isn't just a summer program. It's a movement. New problems are popping up everyday, and people aren't prepared to solve them. We need to not only educate, but inspire the next generation. We need to get rid of the "push" factors that are stopping people from entering the engineering world. And it all starts in the schools. Starting in the fall, Kinet-X will be working with schools- private, charter and public- to help develop Computer Science curriculums, and ways to apply them. Kinet-X is already partnered with  the Pine Street School near Wall Street. If your school is interested in partnering with us, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@kinet-x.org">info@kinet-x.org</a></p>

                    <p style="display:float;align='right'">Adam is a junior at Stuyvesant High School, and has been involved with the tech world for 4 years now. He started off doing basic HTML and python programming in 7th grade and did a lot of work with robotics, Scratch programming and circuitry in 8th grade. In 9th grade he joined his school's robotics team, helping them make it to the East Regionals for the first time ever. In 10th grade, Adam joined the Young Hackers, a group that aims to bring hackathons and technology to underprivelaged minorities. He is currently their Head of Outreach and Website Manager. In addition, Adam was selected by CE Week as their Top 10 Under 20 Innovators in Tech to Watch Out For- an award given to those that are aiming to use technology to make a difference in the world. Adam's only goal is to be able to make people feel the same way he does about STEM and making a change, and Kinet-X is his way of doing just that. </p>
