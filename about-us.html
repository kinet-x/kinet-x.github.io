                            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
							<p>Three high school friends, all with some connection to STEM, discussing what originally got them into the STEM field. The robotics team, their father, a friend. All three were fortunate enough to have some gateway. But what about students that can? Student's growing up in <b>poor neighborhoods</b> and going to <b>underfunded schools</b>? Where do they turn to? They turn to programs. Weekend programs, summer programs. Overpriced programs. How are you suppoed to discover STEM when you need thousands of dollars just to experience it? We decided that needed to change.</p>
							<h3>The Problem</h3>
							<p>The world needs innovators, thinkers and problem solvers. As of right now, the amount of engineering graduates is less than <b>10 percent</b> of that of psychology or law graduates. There are kids who never get to experience engineering, programming or circuitry. Schools just don't offer those programs, summer programs are too expensive and only provide a basic classroom experience. We need a new kind of program. One that makes learning <b>fun</b>, one that <b>inspires</b>. We need <b>Kinet-X</b>.</p>
							<h3>The Solution</h3>
							<p>The idea is simple. A program that makes learning Engineering <b>enjoyable</b>, <b>affordable</b>, <b>educational</b> and <b>makes an impact.</b></p>
				            <div class="list">
                                <b class='title'>Enjoyable</b>
                                <p>It should be obvious that taking notes and staring at a slideshow isn't the best way to learn any form of technical skill- including engineering. Why is it that that's how it's being taught then? Lessons need to be <b>hands-on</b>. Activities have to range in difficulty, from ones that test basic understanding to ones that present a challenge far beyond the students' level, so that no one feels left behind. No one should leave a program feeling empty because they couldn't keep up, or feeling like they learned nothing because they knew it all. Student's should leave a program feeling content, and proud of what they accomplished.</p>
                                <b class='title'>Affordable</b>
                                <p>It's time that price stops being the reason students miss out on discovering their passion. Kinet-X has a base cost of <b>$650</b>- which includes meals/snacks and cost of materials for the entire 4-weeks. However, price is a factor that we refuse to inhibit student's from changing the future, so Kinet-X will offer generous need-based <b>financial aid</b> to those that are enthusiastic about joining our program. </p>
                                <b class='title'>Educational</b>
                                <p>Working with companies like General Assembly and Knewton, we strive to ensure our lesson plans are the best they can be. In addition, our teaching wil be done by high school students, experienced in the tech field and eager to help students enter it. The goal is for students to feel comfortable with their teachers, to not be afraid to make mistakes and ask questions. Mentors, from top tech companies, will also be present to provide assistance as well as connect their experiences to the real world. Students that enjoy Kinet-X and </p>

                            <h3>Making an Impact</h3>
                            <p>Kinet-X isn't just a summer program. It's a movement. New problems are popping up everyday, and people aren't prepared to solve them. We need to not only educate, but inspire the next generation. We need to get rid of the "push" factors that are stopping people from entering the engineering world. And it all starts in the schools. Starting in the fall, Kinet-X will be reaching out to schools- private, charter and public- to help develop Computer Science curriculums, and ways to apply them. Kinet-X already has a set program at the Pine Street School near Wall Street, where we will be hosting a weekend program for a younger age group. If your school is interested in our program, please email us at info@kinet-x.org</p>
