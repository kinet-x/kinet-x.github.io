							<h3 class="icon style1 fa-area-chart">The Problem</h3>
							<p>The world needs innovators, thinkers and problem solvers. As of right now, the amount of engineering graduates is less than 10 percent of that of psychology or law graduates. There are kids who never get to experience engineering, programming or circuitry. Schools just don't offer those programs, summer programs are too expensive and only provide a basic, boring classroom experience. We need a new kind of program. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 class="icon style2 fa-lightbulb-o">The Inspiration</h3>
							<p>Three Stuyvesant sophomores, talking about how they were introduced into the engineering world, realized how difficult it was to get into it. They looked at programs around the city, and saw a scary trend of prices they considered unaffordable. The programs were all run by adults who may have forgotten what it was like originally learning what it was like to program, and lacked a personal connection with the students.  </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 class="icon style3 fa-cube">The Solution</h3>
							<p>Kinet-X - the 4-week engineering summer program aimed at giving students oppurtunities they wouldn't get elsewhere. Students will be able to choose whether they're interested in programming or engineering. After that they will work with a partner, developing the social skills they will need in the professional world. Every day they will learn about new sensors and ideas- putting those to the test when they tackle the activities provided to them daily. The last week will be a self driven project. Partners will design, plan and implement their own project- using all the skills. After leaving the program, students will be inspired and ready with the knowledge and drive they need to make a differe`nce.</p>

					<p>Join now, change your future and change the world. Kinet-X is looking for applicants ages 9-14 (grades 6-9), who are harboring an interest for engineering, programming or innovating. A 4-week program in August, applicants are expected to be available during that time period. The program cost is $650, however we will offer large sums of financial aid to inspired students that can't afford it- it's time that price stops being the reason you can't find your passion. We can't wait to hear from you!</p>
