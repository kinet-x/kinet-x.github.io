								<h2>When and where is the program?</h2>
								<p>The summer 2016 program will begin on August 1 and run through August 26. Sessions will be held from 10AM - 5PM three days a week. It will be hosted at a space donated by Khan's Tutorial in Ozone Park.</p>
								<h2>Do you need prior experience for this program?</h2>
								<p>No. We look for candidates who show initiative, action-orientation, and have a good fit with our values. We look for students who show to us they have what it takes to be successful innovators. There are no minimum grade or activity involvement requirements.</p>
								<h2>What makes Kinet-X unique?</h2>
								<p>We view ourselves less as an enrichment or academic program, and more as an incubator, designed to inspire and train teens to create projects with practical use. We focus on real-world applicability throughout the summer; we minimize classroom time and highly value learning by doing.</p>
