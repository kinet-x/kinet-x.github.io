								<h2><b>How much does Kinet-X cost?</b></h2>
								<p>The estimated tuition for our Fall 2016 program is $975, including activities, & material for the duration of the program. We don't want price to prevent you from attending Kinet-X, so need-based financial aid is available!</p>
								<h2><b>Who teaches the classes?</b></h2>
								<p>Classes are taught by Kinet-X staff, people with background in STEM and the engineering field.</p>
								<h2><b>What grade levels do you accept?</b></h2>
								<p>We accept students currently attending the 5th to 9th grades.</p>
								<h2><b>When and where is the program?</b></h2>
								<p>The Fall 2016 program will begin on October 1 and run through January 7, with days off on holidays. Sessions will be held from 10AM - 5PM on Saturdays. It will be hosted at the wonderful Pine Street School near Wall Street.</p>
								<h2><b>Do you need prior experience for this program?</b></h2>
								<p>No. We look for candidates who show initiative, action-orientation, and have a good fit with our values. These students show to us they have what it takes to be successful innovators. There are no minimum grade or activity involvement requirements.</p>
								<h2><b>Curriculum</b></h2>
								<p>We also know that most programs only focus on either programming or engineering, rarely both, so weâ€™ve centered our curriculum around developing, combining, and applying skills from both areas. Through Kinet-X, students learn everything from soldering to data modeling in Python to product design. By the end of our program, students will have defined, designed, and developed their own practical invention; ready for a successful future in tech.</p>
								<h2><b>What makes Kinet-X unique?</b></h2>
								<p>We view ourselves less as an enrichment or academic program, and more as an incubator, designed to inspire and train teens to create projects with practical use. We focus on real-world applicability throughout the program; we minimize classroom time and highly value learning by doing.</p>
								<h2><b>When is our application deadline?</b></h2>
								<p>Our early application deadline is August 31, 2016, and our regular application deadline is September 14, 2016. We recommend you apply as early as possible!</p>
