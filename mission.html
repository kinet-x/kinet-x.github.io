								<h2>The Beginning</h2>
								<p>Three high school friends, all with some connection to STEM, discussing what originally got them into the STEM field. The robotics team, their father, a friend. All three were fortunate enough to have some gateway. But what about students who don't? Students growing up in poor neighborhoods and going to underfunded schools? Where do they turn to? They turn to extracurricular programs. Weekend programs, summer programs. Overpriced programs. How are you suppoed to discover STEM when you need thousands of dollars just to experience it? We decided that needed to change.</p>
								<h2>The Problem</h2>
								<p>The world needs innovators, thinkers and problem solvers. As of right now, the amount of engineering graduates is less than 10 percent of that of psychology or law graduates. There are kids who never get to experience engineering, programming or circuitry. Schools just don't offer those programs, summer programs are too expensive and only provide a basic classroom experience. We need a new kind of program. One that makes learning fun, one that inspires. We need Kinet-X.</p>
								<h2>Making an Impact</h2>
								<p>Kinet-X isn't just a summer program. It's a movement. New problems are popping up everyday, and people aren't prepared to solve them. We need to not only educate, but inspire the next generation. We need to get rid of the "push" factors that are stopping people from entering the engineering world. And it all starts in the schools. Starting in the fall, Kinet-X will be working with schools- private, charter and public- to help develop Computer Science curriculums, and ways to apply them. Kinet-X is already partnered with the Pine Street School near Wall Street. If your school is interested in partnering with us, please reach out to us at info@kinet-x.org.</p>
