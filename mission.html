								<h1 style="text-align:center;">The Problem</h2>
								<p>STEM is the future. With robotics, self-driving cars and space exploration all growing by the day, it's clear we need a new generation of innovators, think  Many young students begin with an interest in technology but
								that interest fades away due to the lack of opportunities. School
								doesn't provide substantial STEM education and other programs
								are too expensive for students to aford. Kinet-X works with the
								community to provide affordable, project-based learning.
								We teach students to become innovators - the Kinet-X way.</p>
                                <hr>
								<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:2em;margin-top:2%;">What We Saw</h2>
								<p>The STEM world is growing, and everyone knows it. The question is why isn't more being done to support it's growth? Many schools aren't offering CS programs, and even less offer any kind of engineering class. Outside programs are expensive, and generally geared towards older people. How is the new generation supposed to be inspired when there's nothing to get excited about?</p>
                                <h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:2em;margin-top:2%;">The Beginning</h2>
								<p>There needed to be a STEM program out there geared towards the next generation. One that didn't cost thousands of dollars. One that gave you an accurate scope of the STEM world, that taught several topics. A program taught by people that knew what it was like entering the world of tech. That was the start of Kinet-X. </p>
                                <h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:2em;margin-top:2%;">What We've Done</h2>
								<p>Since then, Kinet-X has grown from being an idea and a dream, to being reality. We've emailed and met with employees and heads of tech companies around the city. We've learned about what it takes to teach STEM, and seen what works and what doesn't. Over the summer of 2016, we held our first summer program; which was definitely a success. Read about what the students thought on our <a href="testimonials.html">Testimonials Page</a>!</p>
								<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:2em;">What We're Doing</h2>
								<p>Our curriculum is constantly being improved. What we teach shouldn't be static, lessons are for the students so why shouldn't their input matter? We are reaching out to middle schools all over the city, to try and reach as many people as possible. Also be sure to look out for Kinet-X in the press and online, we're doing everything we can to get out! Change your future, find your passion. <a href="index.html#cta">Sign Up Today</a>.</p>
