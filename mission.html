								<h2>The Problem</h2>
								<p>Many young students begin with an interest in technology but
								that interest fades away due to the lack of opportunities. School
								doesn't provide substantial STEM education and other programs
								are too expensive for students to aford. Kinet-X works with the
								community to provide affordable, project-based learning.
								We teach students to become innovators - the Kinet-X way.</p>
								<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
								<p>Three high school friends, all with some connection to STEM, discussing what originally got them into the STEM field. The robotics team, their father, a friend. All three were fortunate enough to have some gateway. But what about students who don't? Students growing up in poor neighborhoods and going to underfunded schools? Where do they turn to? They turn to extracurricular programs. Weekend programs, summer programs. Overpriced programs. How are you suppoed to discover STEM when you need thousands of dollars just to experience it? We decided that needed to change.</p>

								<p>Three of us, all high schoolers with experience in STEM, were discussing what got us into the STEM fields. Robotics team, family member, a friend. We were all fortunate enough to have an opportunity. But what about students who don’t? Students growing up in poor neighborhoods and going to underfunded schools? Other students who had never once dreamed of becoming a scientist or engineer because it’s not the “right” thing to do for their gender? There are programs and extracurriculars for these students to turn to, but they all have a single — or multiple barriers that prevent these students from truly discovering STEM. Price. Outdated teaching methods. Subpar content. As we realized that, we took it upon ourselves to create a program that would change all of that.</p>
								<h2>The Problem</h2>
								<p>The world needs innovators, thinkers and problem solvers. As of right now, the amount of engineering graduates is less than 10 percent of that of psychology or law graduates. There are kids who never get to experience engineering, programming or circuitry. Schools just don't offer those programs, summer programs are too expensive and only provide a basic classroom experience. We need a new kind of program. One that makes learning fun, one that inspires. We need Kinet-X.</p>

								<h2>Making an Impact</h2>
								<p>Kinet-X isn't just a program. It's a movement. New problems are popping up everyday, and people aren't prepared to solve them. We need to not only educate, but inspire the next generation. We need to get rid of the "push" factors that are stopping people from entering the engineering world. And it all starts in the schools. Starting in the fall, Kinet-X will be working with schools- private, charter and public- to help develop Computer Science curriculums, and ways to apply them. Kinet-X is already partnered with the Pine Street School near Wall Street. If your school is interested in partnering with us, please reach out to us at info@kinet-x.org.</p>
